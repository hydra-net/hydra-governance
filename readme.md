# Hydra voting App

## Requirements

You will need a [Metamask Wallet](https://metamask.io/) with some funds on the Ropsten network, if you need funds you can use one of the following faucets to get some [faucet1](https://faucet.dimensions.network/) [faucet2](https://faucet.ropsten.be/)

You will also need to add the eToken to metamask, for this go to metamask -> assets -> import tokens and add the following token:
```
Token Contract Address: 0x4ED2EA698bB9A74c01EE3EC19F4bE85350ED9856
Token Symbol: eToken
Token Decimal: 0
```
Then contact support to get some tokens.

## How to use

Go to the [App](https://hydra-voting.web.app/) and connect your metamask wallet and you will see a list of proposals you can vote on(either on favour or against), casting a vote will cost you 500 eToken, please note that votes might take some time to register so only click once and wait for the transaction to confirm for your vote to show.

You can also use the `Propose` button on the bottom of the page to add your own that other users can vote on, creating a proposal has the following requirements:
  - Name: The name of your proposal
  - Description: A short description of what you are trying to achive with your proposal
  - Token requirement: The amount of tokens will receive to achive the proposal in case it is approved, this can be a maximum of 1000 eToken
  - fee: submitting a proposal will cost you 1000 eToken (although you need atleast 1001 eToken on your walllet).
  
And once you add a proposal you can't vote on proposals anymore.
